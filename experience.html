                            I am conducting research at BML under Dr. Ronald Fearing and Dr. John Atkins, focused on creating a digital simulation for a 7 degree of freedom MRI Robotic arm on CoppeliaSim. 
                            Having already developed a PD controlled arm, I am implementing a disturbance observer to ensure further stability and safety inside the MRI bore. 
                            To do so I am using bond graphs and transfer functions to derive a steady-state space model for the velocity controlled ultrasonic motors controlling the arm.

                                I am currently designing and validating the Segment Board to monitor our 1403p battery pack. There are 10 segment boards, each monitoring 14 cells.
                                This 4-layer PCB serves as the "brains" for all our battery control.
                                It houses the logic through the ADBMS chip reading in voltage through a board to board connection and temperature values through ribbon cables and muxxing. 
                                Additionally it communicates with other boards through isoSPI and CAN protocols.

                            <p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
                                Validation will be powered by a resistor divider from 52V to simulate one battery pack (14 cells each nominal 3V3). 
                                Balancing will be tested by deploying STM32 code onto another board which will transmite signals over isoSPI to the ADBMS chip.

                            We were tasked to construct a random positioning machine to simulate zero-gravity on Earth for fungi by Magnitude.io. 
                            I designed a two layer PCB and housing containing an ESP-32, terminal blocks for signal/power for our components (optical encoder, motor driver, etc.), and USB-C port. 
                            This board took in 12V and stepped it down to 5V and 3V3. 
                            It had I2C protocol to communicate with a Raspberry Pi, and 8-bit and SPI protocol to communicate with the Adafruit Capacitive Touch Display.
                            Additionally, I helped to develop random paths with random Fourier Transforms and Psuedo-Random Binary Sequence using encoder data.

                            This eventually led to our program's first one in seven years (go eagles)!

                            I am conducting research at BML under Dr. Ronald Fearing and Dr. John Atkins, focused on creating a digital simulation for a 7 degree of freedom MRI Robotic arm on CoppeliaSim. 
                            Having already developed a PD controlled arm, I am implementing a disturbance observer to ensure further stability and safety inside the MRI bore. 
                            To do so I am using bond graphs and transfer functions to derive a steady-state space model for the velocity controlled ultrasonic motors controlling the arm.

                            I am currently designing and validating the Segment Board to monitor our 1403p battery pack. There are 10 segment boards, each monitoring 14 cells.
                            This 4-layer PCB serves as the "brains" for all our battery control.
                            It houses the logic through the ADBMS chip reading in voltage through a board to board connection and temperature values through ribbon cables and muxxing. 
                            Additionally it communicates with other boards through isoSPI and CAN protocols.

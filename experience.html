                            I conduct research at BML under Dr. Ronald Fearing and Dr. John Atkins, focused on developing a high-fidelity simulation of a 7-degree-of-freedom MRI-comptabile robotic arm in CoppeliaSim.
                            I implemented a PD-controlled model of the arm and am extending it to a impedance controller with a disturbance observe to improve stability and safety during operation inside the MRI bore.
                            To accurately capture actuator behavior, I derive velocity-domain system models for ultrasonic motors using bond graphs and transfer-functions, enabilign realistic simulation of actuator dynamcis and control performance.

                                I am currently designing and validating a 4-layer segment-level battery management system (BMS) PCB for a custom 140s3p accumulator, where each segment board monitors fourteen cells.
                                The segment board serves as teh primary control and monitoring unit at the module leve, integrating ADBMS ICs for cell voltage measurements via board-to-board connections and multiplexed temperature sensing through ribbon cables.
                                The system communicates with adjacent boards using isoSPI and CAN, providing robust data transfer and isolation in a high-voltage environment.

                            <p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
                                To validate the design, I sumulate fourteen-cell battery segment using a resistor-divider network stepping down from 52V and verify voltage measurement accuracy and fault behavior. 
                                Cell balacning functionality is tested by deploying STM32 firmware on a companion controller board, which transmits balancing commnads over isoSPI to the ADBMS IC, enabling end-to-end verification of monitoring and control paths.

                            I worked with a multidisciplinary team to develop a random positionig machine designed to simulate microgravity conditions for fungal growth experiments on Earth.
                            I designed a two-layer control PCB and mechanical housing integrating an ESP32, terminal blocks for power and signal interfaces (including an optical encoder and motor driver), and a USB-C interface.
                            The board accepts a 12V input and generates regulated 5V and 3.3V rails for system operation.

                            The controller communicates with a Raspberry PI over 12C and interfaces with an Adafruit capacitive touch display using SPI and GPIO. 
                            In addition, I contributed to the development of randomized motion trajectories using Fourier-series-based methods and pseudo-random binary sequences, leveraging encoder feedback to generate continuously varying orientation paths.

                            As an independent contractor, I executed hardware bring-up and debugged over fifty 2-layer PCBs built around ATmega328p microcontrollers.
                            These boards integrated isolated AC-DC conversion, onboard rectification, and regualted 5V and 3.3V power rails.
                            Using oscilloscopes and multimeters, I verified power integrity, regulation stability, and MCU operation.
                            In parallel, I implemented a solar panel telemetry system that collected current data, displayed it onto LCD interfaces, and transmitted over Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.

                            During my junior and senior years of high school, I was the lead programmer and <span style = "white-space: nowrap;">co-president</span> of our robotics team, team 5805.
                            I led the development of our team's first swerve drive, implemented vision-based target tracking using PhotonVision, and developed autonomous routines with PathPlanner.
                            Additionally, I helped wire the robot and machine parts for our telescopic elevator and chassis subsystems. 
                            This eventually led to our program's first one in seven years.

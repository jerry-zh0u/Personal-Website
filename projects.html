                                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing">Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)</a> is a foundational technique in fiber-optic communication that enables multiple data streams to be transmitted simultaneously over a single optical channel by assigning each stream a distinct wavelength.
                                Each wavelength id independently modulated, optically combined using wavelength-selective elements, transmitted through a shared medium, and then seperated and detected at the reciever

                            <p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
                                Inspired by this principle, I built a three-port optical WDM system using laser points, trichroic crystals, photodetectors, and Arudino-based control.
                                The trichroic crystals were used to multiplex and demultiplex three laser wavelengths, with each channel implementing independent data transmission.
                                I developed a custom communication protocl for the green laser and using Arduino Serial communication for the remaining channels, achieving a 92% end-to-end transmission accuracy.
                                Mechanical alignment was done through custom-desigend mounts modeled in Fusino 360 and 3D printed.
                                We also evaluated system robustness by introducing optical disturbances and implementing basica data recovery logic.

                                Building on the <a href = "https://sciencenotes.org/double-slit-experiment/">classical double slit experiment</a>, this project explored the role of polarization in wave interference and its impact on observable diffraction patterns.
                                Motivated by <a href = "https://faculty.csbsju.edu/frioux/two-slit/PolarDoubleSlit.pdf">prior literature</a> on polarized interference, the goal was to experimentally reproduce and quantify how varying degrees of polarization affect fringe visibility and intensity distribution.

                                The experimental setup used a 650 nm diode laser, linear and variable polarizers, and a photodiode connected to an Arduino-based data acquisition system. 
                                By varying polarization states, I observed that introducing polarization aligned with slit infromation caused the interference pattern to collapse into a single-slit-like distribution, consistent with theoretical predictions.
                                In addition, I experimentally verified Malus's Law by measuring transmitted intensity as a function of polarizer angle. This project emphasized experimental reproductibility, quantitative measurement, and comparison against analytical models.

                                This projecte investigated the performance trade-offs between k-d trees and quadtress for spatial data storage and query operations. 
                                I implemented both data structures from scratch in Java, supporting insertion, deletion, nearest-neighbor search, range queries, and rebalancing.

                                To optimize space and query efficiency, each tree was initially constructed by partitioning around the median of the dataset, followed by periodic rebalancing.
                                Median selection was implemented using a modified <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians">median of medians algorithm</a> to achieve a deterministic performance without recursive subdivision.
                                Through benchmarking across varying dataset densities and query types, I observed that performance depended strongly on dimensionality and rebalancing strategy.
                                While quadtrees performed competitively in low-dimensional, structured datasets, k-d trees demonstrated superior scalability into higher-dimensional spaces, with measured performance gains of approximately 7% on dense, non-unform 2d-datasets.

                                For my implementation of these data-structures, I found that the efficiency of quadtrees and k-d trees were dependent on operation and rebalancing steps.
                                However, for larger dimensional data k-d trees are easily extendable, whereas its harder/not efficient to extend higher dimensional data into quadtrees

                                I developed a fully functional interpreter for the Scheme programming language in Python, implementing core language features including expression parsing, evaluation, and environment management.
                                The interpreter supports both lexical and dynamic scoping through chained environments, enabling correct handling of closures and variable resolution.
                                Additionally functionality includes user-defined procedures, arithmetic and logical primitives, and higher-order functions, adhering closely to Scheme's evaluation semantics.
